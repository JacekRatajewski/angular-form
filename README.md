 ## Day 2 - Init Project & Sign In Page
On the second day of assignment i initialized angular project. I choose to use Sass for style pre-processor and added angular material for basic components. I changed default **app.component** from standalone and used module based architecture for future project expansion. I decided to use **BEM** with hyphen separation naming standard for css, also i created styles folder with reduced **7-1 Architecture**, for Angular standards.

I started implementation of routing and **sign-in-page.component**.
